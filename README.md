# machine-learning-project

This repo is a group project on machine learning (4523 Data Analytic at Columbia University)

Employed machine learning classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Gradient Boosting to
enhance the recommendation system's ability to predict premium categories. Applied the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique to address the issue of imbalanced categorical data.
Applied K-means algorithm to cluster customers based on their lifetime value, conducted EDA to understand
each customer cluster, and used the insight to build the regression model predicting customer lifetime value.
